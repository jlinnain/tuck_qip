    "- If your kernel crashes, it is typically a sign that your kernels are using too much memory\n",
    "- What to do?\n",
    "  1. If you have multiple tabs open, each one of them associates with its own kernel -- which means that each one of them is using some memory. It might help to close all tabs except the one you're working on.\n",
    "  2. In the notebook I don't typically discard objects we no longer need (we could do so with \"del <object>\" command). To conserve memory, you might start a fresh kernel, execute the import statements, and then skip to the point that you really need to run. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    This might sometimes be tricky because you want to load the right data -- but in most notebooks I save the final data precisely for this reason so that most of the code can later be skipped."
